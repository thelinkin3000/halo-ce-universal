/*
HALO_PORT_WINDOW.H

Where the game's memory window is, for the ports that cannot put it at
0x80000000.

The Xbox maps physical memory at virtual 0x80000000 + P, and the game data
is written for that: a map file's tag cache sits at 0x803a6000, every tag
instance in it names where its data and its name are, and those values are
addresses in the window. Android's Java runtime has usually mapped its
large object space across 0x80000000 by the time the app runs, and that
space cannot be taken from it, so the host puts the window somewhere free
and the guest is told where (halo_guest_boot.contiguous_base, read into
platform_contiguous_base before any constructor runs).

The window stays a whole number of 256 MB and larger than the 128 MB the
game uses, so the arithmetic that turns a physical address into a virtual
one (an offset added to the base, or an address masked with its
complement) still gives the right answer wherever it lands.

Game sources include this where they name a fixed place in the window, and
translate it; the byte-matching MSVC build does not include it and compiles
the original constants. port/linux/src/platform.h owns the window itself.
