This project is a port of the Halo: Combat Evolved decompilation to Linux,
Windows, Android and the Nintendo Switch. The decompilation is of the Xbox build 2342
(`cachebeta.exe`, SHA-256
`4cc87b45f721270392a96f1674ed2b5cd4a7bb4355faeab4531d1cf1884d9520`).

The port starts from the decompilation of [bnunu/halo-1](https://github.com/bnunu/halo-1).
That project is a fork of [punpckhdq/halo](https://github.com/punpckhdq/halo).

## Download

GitHub Actions builds the game for each commit. These links download the
builds of the latest release:

| Platform | Release | Debug |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | [halo-linux-release.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-linux-release.zip) | [halo-linux-debug.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-linux-debug.zip) |
| Windows | [halo-windows-release.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-windows-release.zip) | [halo-windows-debug.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-windows-debug.zip) |
| Android | [halo-android-release.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-android-release.zip) | [halo-android-debug.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-android-debug.zip) |
| Nintendo Switch | [halo-switch-release.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-switch-release.zip) | [halo-switch-debug.zip](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases/latest/download/halo-switch-debug.zip) |

Use the release build to play. The debug build stops at the first failed
assertion and writes it to the log. Use the debug build to find and report
problems.

The game updates itself. At start-up it looks for a newer release, and asks
if you want to install it. Refer to "Updates" in
[port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md#updates).

Each build of the `main` branch that passes on all four platforms is a new
release. The [Releases](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE/releases)
page keeps the last five releases. If the latest build has a problem, get
an older build from that page.

## Game data

The port does not include the game data. Download an Xbox disc image
(`.xiso` or `.iso`) of Halo: Combat Evolved. All versions of the game
operate. The maps of the European (PAL) version were made for a slower
console. The port changes them to play as the North American (NTSC) maps do,
so players of the two versions can play together.

1. Start the game.
2. At the first start, the game asks for the disc image. Select it.
3. The game extracts the `maps/` folder. Then the game starts.

On Linux and Windows, the game puts `maps/` next to the executable. On
Android, copy the disc image to the phone first. The app puts `maps/` in its
data folder. Refer to [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md).

On the Nintendo Switch there is no file browser to pick the image with, so put
the disc image on the card yourself:

```
sdmc:/switch/halo/halo.iso
```

The game finds it there on the first run and unpacks `maps/` itself, which
takes a few minutes and writes about 1.7 GB, so leave the card in and keep that
much space free. The log says which file it is copying and how far it has got.
If you would rather unpack it yourself, `maps/` still works: put it at
`sdmc:/switch/halo/maps/` and the game uses it as it is. The log is at
`sdmc:/switch/halo/halo.log`.

## Platforms

Each platform has its own instructions:

| Platform | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Linux (32-bit x86 executable, OpenGL 4.5, SDL3) | [port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md) |
| Windows (32-bit x86 executable, OpenGL 4.5, SDL3) | [port/windows/README.md](port/windows/README.md) |
| Android (arm64 app, OpenGL ES 3, SDL3) | [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md) |
| Nintendo Switch (homebrew program, OpenGL ES 3, SDL2) | see the notes below |

The Linux README also gives the controls, the settings and the multiplayer
functions. These are almost the same on all platforms.

## Multiplayer

The game can play system link games on a local network and on the internet:

- A system link game can have up to 128 players on up to 128 machines.
- Linux, Windows and Android machines can play in the same game.
- An invite link lets a machine join a game on the internet. No server of
  this project is necessary.
- The netcode is new. Each machine moves its own player at once,
  and the host makes the decisions for the game. Refer to
  [port/linux/NETCODE.md](port/linux/NETCODE.md).

## Build the game

You do not need the Xbox SDK. The port supplies the SDK declarations that
the game uses. Refer to [port/include/xdk](port/include/xdk/README.md).

To build the game:

1. Install Python and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).
2. Install the tools for your platform. Refer to the README for the
   platform.
3. In the root folder of the repository, enter `python configure.py`.
4. Enter `ninja` with the target for the platform:

| Target | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `ninja linux` | `build/linux/halo` |
| `ninja windows` (on Windows) | `build/windows/halo.exe` and `SDL3.dll` |
| `ninja android_apk` | `port/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` |
| `ninja switch` | `build/switch/halo.nro` and `build/switch/halo_guest.elf` |

The Switch needs two toolchains and neither can be replaced by the other.
devkitPro builds the host (`devkitA64`, `libnx`, `switch-sdl2`,
`switch-mesa`, `switch-libdrm_nouveau`), and the Android NDK builds the game
image, which is ILP32 AArch64 - 32-bit pointers, because the Xbox data
formats embed them and have to keep their layout. devkitA64 cannot build it,
being LP64 only. So the Switch build wants the same NDK as the Android build,
found as it is there, plus devkitPro:

```
sudo dkp-pacman -S --needed devkitA64 libnx switch-sdl2 switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau
```

`configure.py` finds devkitPro through `DEVKITPRO`, or `/opt/devkitpro`, or
`~/devkitpro`. Both files are needed to run: the NRO is the program, and the
ELF is the game image it loads from the card.

If you enter `ninja` without a target, ninja builds the game for the
computer that you use.

`tools/ci_build.py` makes the same builds as GitHub Actions. For example,
enter `python tools/ci_build.py linux release`.

### Build options

Give these options to `configure.py`:

| Option | Result |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | A debug build. A failed assertion stops the game. |
| `--release` | A release build. The game does not examine assertions, as in the retail game. |
| `--portable` | The Linux and Windows builds operate on all x86-64 processors. The Linux build also operates on older distributions and on SteamOS: refer to "Portable build" in [port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md#portable-build). Use this option for builds that you give to other persons. |
| `--lto=thin`, `--lto=off` | Less link-time optimization. The link is faster. |
| `--pgo=off` | No profile-guided optimization. |
| `--pgo=train` | Records a new optimization profile. Refer to "Optimization profiles". |

Without `--portable`, the Linux and Windows builds use all the instructions
of the processor that builds them (`-march=native`). Such a build does not
always start on a different computer.

### Optimization profiles

The builds use profiles of the game to optimize the code:

- `pgo/halo_linux.profdata` for Linux and Android.
- `pgo/halo_windows.profdata` for Windows.

The profiles need clang 22 or later. With an older clang, the builds do not
use the profiles.

To record a new profile:

1. Delete the profile.
2. Enter `python configure.py --pgo=train`.
3. Enter `ninja linux` or `ninja windows`.

The build then plays the main menu and the first minute of each campaign
level. This procedure continues for approximately 15 minutes. The game
data must be in `assets/`.
